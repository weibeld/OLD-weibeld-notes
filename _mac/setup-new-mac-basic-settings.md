This is a checklist for setting up and personalising a new Mac.

See [Setting Up a New Mac: Tools and Apps](setup-new-mac-tools-and-apps.html) for apps and tools to install on a new Mac.

> Last used for macOS Sonoma 14.2.1 on a MacBook Air M1 (2020).

# Customise keyboard

1. Install the Logitech Swiss German keyboard layout by following the instructions [here (GitHub)](https://github.com/weibeld-personalisation/logitech-swiss-german-keyboard-layout).
1. Go to _**System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts... > Modifier Keys...**_, and do the following:
   1. Set _**Caps Lock**_ to _**Control**_
   1. Set _**Control**_ to _**Caps Lock**_
   1. Set _**Option**_ to _**Command**_
   1. Set _**Command**_ to _**Option**_
   > This swaps the functions of the _**Caps Lock**_ and _**Control**_, and _**Option**_ and _**Command**_ keys, respectively.
1. Go to _**System Preferences > Keyboard**_, and set _**Press üåê key to**_ to _**Do Nothing**_
   > This disables the globe functionality and makes the globe (üåê) key act like a normal _**fn**_ key, which is necessary for [Fluor](https://github.com/Pyroh/Fluor) (will be installed later). The input source can always be changed with _Control-Space_, even without the globe key.


# Install Homebrew and default Homebrew formulas

1. Install Homebrew by executing the following command (may also be copied from <https://brew.sh>):
   ```bash
   bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
1. Install the default Homebrew formulas from [weibeld-personalisation/brewfile](https://github.com/weibeld-personalisation/brewfile) by executing the following commands:
   ```bash
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weibeld-personalisation/brewfile/main/Brewfile >Brewfile
   /opt/homebrew/bin/brew bundle install --file Brewfile
   ```

> **Note:** on Macs with Intel chips, the path of the `brew` executable is `/usr/local/bin` instead of `/opt/homebrew/bin` (see [documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#why-should-i-install-homebrew-in-the-default-location)).


# Set Bash as the default shell

To set the version of Bash installed by Homebrew as the default shell instead of the native Zsh, do the following (see more information in [Upgrading Bash on macOS](https://itnext.io/upgrading-bash-on-macos-7138bd1066ba)):

1. Execute the following commands:
   ```bash
   echo /opt/homebrew/bin/bash | sudo tee -a /etc/shells >/dev/null
   chsh -s /opt/homebrew/bin/bash
   sudo chsh -s /opt/homebrew/bin/bash
   ```
1. Close and reopen the terminal application and verify that the version of Bash installed by Homebrew is running:
   ```bash
   echo $SHELL
   ```

> **Note:** on Macs with Intel chips, the Homebrew base directory is `/usr/local` instead of `/opt/homebrew` (see [documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#why-should-i-install-homebrew-in-the-default-location)), that is, the path to the Bash binary in that case is `/usr/local/bin/bash` instead of `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash`.


# Install custom dotfiles

```bash
curl -Lks http://bit.ly/get-my-dotfiles | bash
```

The [weibeld/dotfiles](https://github.com/weibeld/dotfiles) repository hosts a set of dotfiles (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, etc.) with customisations for various tools. The above command downloads and installs these dotfiles. Detailed instructions can be found in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/weibeld/869f723063811e5088708a9386bf52bf).

# Customise iTerm2
> TODO: use Git Credential Manager (GCM): https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git?platform=mac
1. Go to _iTerm2 > Settings...> General > Preferences_
1. Check _Load preferences from a custom folder or URL_
1. Enter the following URL into the text field:
    ```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weibeld/iterm2-settings/main/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist
    ```
1. Quit iTerm2 and restart it to apply the customised settings

The [weibeld/iterm2-settings](https://github.com/weibeld/iterm2-settings) repository hosts a complete customised iTerm2 configuration description.

# Set Up GitHub Credentials

> TODO: use Git Credential Manager (GCM): https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git?platform=mac

1. On GitHub, create a new personal access token
  - _Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)_
1. Push a commit to any GitHub repository
  - In the appearing prompt, enter your username and the personal access token created above

After this initial authentication, the [`git-credential-osxkeychain`](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/updating-credentials-from-the-macos-keychain) helper saves the credentials in Keychain Access and automatically retrieves them whenever they are needed. 

# Configure Fluor

Start [Fluor](https://github.com/Pyroh/Fluor), click its icon in the menu bar, and set _Trigger_ to the rightmost option (key). This allows switching mode by simply pressing the _fn_ key.

If you have a globe (üåê) key hosted together with the _fn_ key, make sure to disable the globe key functionality, as explained in [Setting Up a New Mac: Basic Settings](setup-new-mac-basic-settings.html). Otherwise, the globe functionality may interfer with Fluor.

# Set Up Google Drive to Mirror Files

1. Click on _Google Drive_ in the menu bar, then _Preferences > Google Drive > Mirror files_
1. Create and select a folder in which to mirror the Google Drive files
  - This folder will directly contain the content of Google Drive, i.e. no additional top-level folder will be created
  - For example, create and select the folder `~/Desktop/Google Drive`

The above settings make sure that the entire content of Google Drive is downloaded to the local machine (in the specified folder) and kept in sync with the server side of Google Drive. By default, Google Drive uses the Streaming mode where files are only downloaded on demand, e.g. when they are opened on the local machine.

# Install AdBlock in Chrome
