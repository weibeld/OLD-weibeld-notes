This is a checklist for basic apps and tools to install on a new Mac.

See [Setting Up a New Mac: Basic Settings](setup-new-mac-basic-settings.html) for initial actions and settings on a new Mac.

> Last used for setting up macOS Ventura 13.4 on MacBook Pro (model A2779).

# Install Homebrew

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

See [Homebrew homepage](https://brew.sh/). Also add the `brew` command to the `PATH` as explained in the output of above command.

# Install Tools and Apps from Brewfile

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weibeld/brewfile/main/Brewfile >Brewfile
brew bundle install --file Brewfile
```

The [weibeld/brewfile](https://github.com/weibeld/brewfile) repository hosts a [Brewfile](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/brewfile-a-gemfile-but-for-homebrew) with a foundational set of tools and apps to be installed on a new Mac. The above command retrieves this Brewfile and installs its content.

# Set Bash as the Default Shell

The following sets the Homebrew Bash version as the default shell:

```bash
sudo sh -c "echo $(brew --prefix)/bin/bash >>/etc/shells"
chsh -s $(brew --prefix)/bin/bash
sudo chsh -s $(brew --prefix)/bin/bash
```

The first command above adds the shell to the list of shells that may be used as login shells. The second and third commands set the shell as the default shell for the current user and root, respectively. Further details can be found in the [Upgrading Bash on macOS](https://itnext.io/upgrading-bash-on-macos-7138bd1066ba#a9cc) article on Medium.

Note that the Homebrew base directory varies depending on whether macOS runs on Intel or Apple chips (see [here](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#why-should-i-install-homebrew-in-the-default-location)):

- Intel chips: `/usr/local`
- Apple chips: `/opt/homebrew`

The Homebrew base directory can always be queried with `brew --prefix`.

After doing all of the above, close the current terminal window and open a new one in order to use Bash as the default shell.

# Install Dotfiles

```bash
curl -Lks http://bit.ly/get-my-dotfiles | bash
```

The [weibeld/dotfiles](https://github.com/weibeld/dotfiles) repository hosts a set of dotfiles (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, etc.) with customisations for various tools. The above command downloads and installs these dotfiles. Detailed instructions can be found in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/weibeld/869f723063811e5088708a9386bf52bf).

# Customise iTerm2

1. Go to _iTerm2 > Settings...> General > Preferences_
1. Check _Load preferences from a custom folder or URL_
1. Enter the following URL into the text field: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weibeld/iterm2-settings/main/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist>
1. Quit iTerm2 and restart it to apply the customised settings

# Set Up Git Credentials

# Set Chrome as the Default Browser

# Configure Fluor

Start Fluor, click its icon in the menu bar, and set _Trigger_ to the rightmost option (key). This allows switching mode by simply pressing the _fn_ key.

If you have a globe (üåê) key hosted together with the _fn_ key, make sure to disable the globe key action, as explained in [Setting Up a New Mac: Basic Settings](setup-new-mac-basic-settings.html). Otherwise, the globe functionality interfers with Fluor.

# Optional: Install an "Open Terminal Here" Tool for Finder

[*cd to*](https://github.com/jbtule/cdto) is a plugin for the Finder toolbar which allows to open a terminal window in the current directory.

- Download the latest release of *cd to* from [here](https://github.com/jbtule/cdto) (ZIP file).
- Unzip the file
- Copy the `cd to.app` file of the directory named after the desired terminal to the `/Applications` folder
    - For example, if you want to use **iTerm2**, use the file `iterm/cd to.app`
- From the `/Applications` folder, hold *Alt-Cmd* and drag the `cd to.app` file onto the toolbar of any Finder window

Now the plugin is installed.
